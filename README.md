The increasing prevalence of high-dimensional environments in various fields, such 
as network analysis, computational biology, and data mining, has highlighted the critical 
issue of node overlap in complex data structures. Node overlap occurs when multiple data 
points occupy the same or similar positions within the high-dimensional space, leading to 
challenges in visualization, analysis, and interpretation. This paper introduces a list-based 
approach for the detection and prevention of node overlap in high-dimensional 
environments, offering an innovative solution to enhance the robustness and reliability of 
data analysis. The proposed method leverages the inherent structure of lists to efficiently 
identify and mitigate node overlap. By representing data points as elements within lists, 
the algorithm employs a systematic approach to detect overlapping nodes based on their 
positional relationships. Through a comprehensive analysis of pairwise node interactions, 
the algorithm constructs a list-based representation of the data, facilitating the 
identification of overlapping nodes within the high-dimensional space. To prevent node 
overlap, the algorithm incorporates a dynamic adjustment mechanism that reorganizes the 
placement of nodes within the lists. This adaptive process aims to disperse overlapping 
nodes and optimize their positions, ensuring a more accurate representation of the 
underlying data structure. The dynamic adjustment mechanism takes into consideration the 
local and global contexts of each node, adapting its position based on the characteristics of 
neighboring nodes and the overall distribution of data points. The effectiveness of the 
proposed approach is validated through extensive experiments conducted on diverse highdimensional datasets. Comparative analyses demonstrate that the list-based approach 
outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, scalability, and computational 
efficiency. Visualization results illustrate the enhanced clarity and interpretability achieved 
by mitigating node overlap, providing researchers and practitioners with a valuable tool for 
extracting meaningful insights from complex data. Furthermore, the proposed method is 
versatile and applicable across various domains, offering a flexible solution to the 
challenges posed by high-dimensional data.
